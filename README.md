## Database Schema

The application uses two main tables:

### games
- `game_id`: Unique 6-character game identifier
- `host_name`: Name of the game host
- `current_calls`: JSON array of called words
- `is_active`: Boolean flag for game status
- `winner`: Name of the winner (if any)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

### players
- `player_id`: Unique UUID for each player
- `game_id`: Reference to the game
- `player_name`: Player's display name
- `card`: JSON array of bingo card words
- `marked`: JSON array of marked squares (booleans)
- `joined_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

## Game Words

The game includes 30 birthday-themed words:
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CAKE, CANDLES, PRESENTS, BALLOONS
- PARTY HAT, MUSIC, DANCING, FRIENDS, FAMILY
- LAUGHTER, PHOTOS, MEMORIES, CELEBRATION, WISHES
- CONFETTI, STREAMERS, GAMES, FUN, JOY
- SMILE, CHEERS, TOAST, SURPRISE, HUGS
- SINGING, DECORATIONS, FOOD, DRINKS, ENTERTAINMENT

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Flask with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with responsive design
- **QR Codes**: Generated using the `qrcode` Python library
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for player/host identification

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various platforms:

### Heroku
1. Add your Supabase credentials to Heroku config vars
2. Deploy using Git or GitHub integration

### Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Add environment variables in the Railway dashboard

### Render
1. Connect your repository
2. Set environment variables in the Render dashboard

## Customization

You can easily customize the game by:
- Modifying the `bingo_words` list in `app.py` to change the words
- Updating the styling in the HTML templates
- Adding new features like sound effects or different game modes
- Changing colors and themes in the CSS

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Game not found**: Make sure the game ID is correct and the game is still active
- **Players can't join**: Ensure all devices can access the host computer/server
- **Database connection errors**: Check your Supabase credentials in the `.env` file
- **QR code not working**: Make sure the URL in the QR code matches your server address

### Fallback Mode

If Supabase is not configured, the application will fall back to in-memory storage. This means:
- Games will only persist while the server is running
- Restarting the server will clear all games
- Multiple server instances won't share data

## Development

### Setting up for development

1. Follow the setup instructions above
2. The application runs in debug mode by default
3. Changes to Python files will auto-reload the server

### Contributing

Feel free to fork this project and add your own features! Some ideas:
- Different themes (wedding, graduation, etc.)
- Sound effects and animations
- Multiple game modes (different win conditions)
- Score tracking and leaderboards
- Tournament brackets
